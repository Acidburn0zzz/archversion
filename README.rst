INTRODUCTION
============
*archversion* is an upstream version controller against current *Archlinux* [#]_
or *AUR* [#]_ version.
It can be used by Dev and TUs to check if new release of their package are available.

HOW TO USE IT
=============
The first thing to do is to define a list of package to track by creating a file
~/.config/archversion.conf. This file look like an old fashioned INI file.

You can find a nice example of this file in misc directory.

Then you can run:
*archversion check -d* to only display version which differ with cache.
*archversion check -n* to only display new verions.
*archversion check -nd* to display new versions not in cache.

Of course you can add the last one in a cron job to get a daily report of which
packages need updates.


COMPARING MODES

official Archlinux repository.
You can compare upstream version against:
- An Archlinux package
- An AUR package
- A stored value
